# Annual minimum Arctic sea ice extent projections and uncertainty quantifications under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios
This repository contains the final version of my bachelor thesis - Annual minimum Arctic sea ice extent projections and uncertainty quantifications under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. I am proud that this thesis was awarded the "Undergraduate Project Prize" by the board of examiners of that year.

I would like to sincerely thank my supervisor, Prof. Richard Chandler, for his numerous supports and professional guidance throughout the process. His assistance has made this
dissertation experience a remarkably fruitful, inspiring, and unforgettable experience
